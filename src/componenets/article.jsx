        "Trump hits India with punishing 50% tariffs for buying Russian oil",

      President Donald Trump's promised 50% tariffs on India took effect on Wednesday, as the U.S. risks blowing up a relationship considered crucial in its effort to counter the rise of China.

Trump started the tariff rate at 25% but doubled it earlier this month as punishment for India buying Russian oil, making it one of the highest of the many tariffs imposed during Trump's ongoing global trade war.

India, one of the world's fastest growing economies and a key partner for the West in the Indo-Pacific region, is heavily reliant on trade with the U.S., its largest export market.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to stand firm in the face of what he termed "the politics of economic selfishness."

The 50% levy risks decades of warming of ties between Washington and New Delhi.

The tariffs are a reversal of the favorable position India seemed to enjoy early in the second Trump administration due to its expanding economic relationship with America, its strategic importance on China and Trump's personal relationship with Modi.

Vice President JD Vance — whose wife is the daughter of Indian immigrants — told NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday that the U.S. had applied "aggressive economic leverage" on India to "try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.”

The U.S. followed through on its threat, which could be a sharp blow to half of India's exports and force affected merchants to diversify to other markets, such as Latin America and the Middle East.

Stock markets in India remained closed on Wednesday due to a public holiday.

But Modi has vowed to defend the country's farmers and small businesses.

“For me, the interests of farmers, small businesses and dairy are topmost. My government will ensure they aren’t impacted,” Modi said at a rally this week in his home state of Gujarat.

Modi says he aims to 'Make India Great Again'

India and the U.S. are yet to reach a bilateral trade deal, even after holding five rounds of negotiations. That's mostly because India is unwilling to open those sectors to cheaper American imports as it could threaten the livelihood of millions of Indians.

The Indian leader is also under immense domestic pressure not to cave to the U.S., but Trump has shown little sign of softening his demand that India stop buying Russian oil as he shifted his focus in recent weeks to brokering peace in Ukraine.

India's continued purchase of Russian oil is actually informed by past U.S. requests to keep the price of oil low amid Western-led sanctions on Russia.

“They bought Russian oil because we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil,” Eric Garcetti, the U.S. ambassador to India under President Joe Biden, said at a conference last year. "It was actually the design of the policy, because as a commodity we didn’t want oil prices going up.”

India is now paying a steep price for that."`,

        `President Trump announced Monday that he placed Washington D.C.’s police department under federal control and would deploy the National Guard to make the district safe.

Trump signed an executive order on August 11 declaring a “crime emergency” in the nation’s capital. He cited the alleged August 3 assault of a former staff member of the Department of Government Efficiency to justify the unprecedented move. 

“Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and blood thirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,” Trump claimed. 

Trump also rattled off a number of major U.S. cities, including New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, and mentioned Oakland among “very bad” cities. 

“We have other cities that are very bad and then you have of course, Baltimore and Oakland,” Trump said. “We don’t even mention that anymore, they’re so far gone.”

Mayor Lee: Trump is fear-mongering
Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee and other cities have pushed back Trump’s narrative of lawlessness and disorder, citing trends of lower crime rates and prioritization of public safety. 

“President Trump’s characterization of Oakland is wrong and based in fear-mongering in an attempt to score cheap political points,” Mayor Lee said in a statement. “Public safety is one of my top priorities, and we’ve made progress to keep our neighborhoods safe and clean – prioritizing a comprehensive public safety approach that includes law enforcement, violence prevention, and community policing.”


A week earlier, Lee hosted a press conference to announce a drop in crime, according to Oakland Police, in the first six months of 2025 compared to last year. In cities mentioned by Trump, local leaders noted similar trends. “Overall crime in our city is down 28% from last year. We still have work to do and my administration will be relentless in our work to ensure our families are kept safe,” Lee added. 

Let’s clean up Oakland ourselves
District 7 Councilmember Ken Houston (East Oakland) responded on Facebook to Trump’s reference.

“Let’s take care of our own city before the federal government step(s) in to do it for us!!!” Houston wrote. “Let’s clean it up ourselves. ”Trump has lampooned Oakland before.

Trump’s comments echo past narratives of race and crime
Trump has mentioned Oakland before. In an August 31, 2020 pandemic conference — where  he referred to Covid-19 as the “ChinaVirus” — Trump took aim at Democratic controlled cities and alleged “left-wing political violence.”

While the cities Trump mentioned are led by Democratic Party officials, many have had sizable Black populations. Trump’s portrayal of these places as crime-ridden echoes both his own history of demonizing groups like the Exonerated Five (formerly the Central Park Five) and how race and crime perceptions influence public policy decisions.

Earlier this year, Trump deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles to quell protests against the administration’s immigration raids. California is suing the federal government over what they call an illegal, anxiety-inducing deployment.

State, federal oversight of Oakland
Governor Gavin Newsom has also deployed state law enforcement to Oakland. Oakland Police have been under federal oversight for 22 years. In July, Oakland Public Schools just emerged from state receivership after 22 years.`,

        `"More than 100,000 Ukrainian homes have been left without power by the latest Russian drone attacks on energy infrastructure, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.

The Poltava, Sumy and Chernihiv regions were affected, Zelensky stated in a post on Telegram.

Ukraine's energy ministry said it was a continuation of Moscow's policy of destroying civilian infrastructure ahead of winter. Last year, Ukraine said Russia had destroyed half of its electricity-generating capacity.

But more recently Ukrainian strikes have also hit Russian refineries and an oil depot.

What security guarantees for Ukraine would actually mean
In his post on Wednesday, Zelensky said Russia had carried out almost 100 drone attacks overnight. Energy facilities were the main targets, but a school in the Kharkiv region and a high-rise building in Kherson were also hit, he said.

"New steps are needed to put pressure on Russia to stop the strikes and truly guarantee security. We are working with partners for such pressure," Zelensky added.

Three and a half years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, fighting on the ground shows no sign of abating.

On Tuesday a Ukrainian military official acknowledged that Russian forces had crossed into the Dnipropetrovsk region for the first time - but said the advance had been stopped.

Moscow has not laid claim to Dnipropetrovsk, unlike Donetsk and Ukraine's four other eastern regions.

On Wednesday Russia's defence ministry said its troops had seized a village in Donetsk. Although Russian forces have suffered high casualties, they have made recent gains in the region.

The latest international effort to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine was launched by US President Donald Trump earlier this month. He met his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska and Zelensky with European leaders in Washington.

Trump had been pushing for a Putin-Zelensky summit. Ukraine's president has backed the move, but he has sought security guarantees from Western allies to prevent any future Russian attack in the event of a peace deal.

On Tuesday Zelensky met the head of Britain's armed forces, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, in Kyiv, as the UK would be ready to put troops on the ground once hostilities had ended.

Also on Tuesday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said security guarantees for Ukraine would first and foremost enable the Ukrainian army to defend their country in the long term."`,
